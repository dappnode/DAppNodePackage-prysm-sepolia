Sepolia was originally a proof-of-authority testnet created by Ethereum core developers in October 2021. It transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism after Ropsten testnet reached a Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) of 50000000000000000.

Testnets are designed to mimic Ethereum's mainnet environment, and Sepolia was created to simulate harsh network conditions with shorter block times for faster transaction confirmation times. 

Unlike other testnets like Goerli, Sepolia's total number of testnet tokens is uncapped, reducing the likelihood of testnet token scarcity for developers.
