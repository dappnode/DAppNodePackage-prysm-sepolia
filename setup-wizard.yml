    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Prysm up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Prysm from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check the [Prysm docs](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/checkpoint-sync) for more information.
      You can use the EF DevOps endpoint `https://checkpoint-sync.sepolia.ethpandaops.io`, the BeaconState.info endpoint `https://sepolia.beaconstate.info` or the Lodestar (ChainSafe) endpoint `https://beaconstate-sepolia.chainsafe.io`.
      *Note - If you are going to provide your own checkpoint sync endpoint, make sure you do not use a slash `/` at the end of the URL.*
